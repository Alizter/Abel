# Developing Abel Theorem

## With nix.

1. Install nix:
  - To install it on a single-user unix system where you have admin
    rights, just type:

    > sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)

    You should run this under your usual user account, not as
    root. The script will invoke `sudo` as needed.

    For other configurations (in particular if multiple users share
    the machine) or for nix uninstallation, go to the [appropriate
    section of the nix
    manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-installing-binary).

  - You need to **log out of your desktop session and log in again** before you proceed to step 2.

  - Step 1. only need to be done once on a same machine.

2. Open a new terminal. Navigate to the root of the Abel repository. Then type:
   > nix-shell

   - This will download and build the required packages, wait until
     you get a shell.
   - You need to type this command every time you open a new terminal.
   - You can call `nixEnv` after you start the nix shell to see your
     work environemnet (or call `nix-shell` with option `--arg
     print-env true`).

3. You are now in the correct work environment. You can do
   > make

   and do whatever you are accustomed to do with Coq.

4. In particular, you can edit files using `emacs` or `coqide`.

   - If you were already using emacs with proof general, make sure you
     empty your `coq-prog-name` variables and any other proof general
     options that used to be tied to a previous local installation of
     Coq.
   - If you do not have emacs installed, but want to use it, you can
     go back to step 2. and call `nix-shell` with the following option
     > nix-shell --arg withEmacs true

     in order to get a temporary installation of emacs and
     proof-general.  Make sure you add `(require 'proof-site)` to your
     `$HOME/.emacs`.
